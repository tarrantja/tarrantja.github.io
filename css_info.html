        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>CSS is a method for managing a site's overall style through a separate stylesheet. CSS allows styling to be
            separated from content (written in HTML) and applied consistently across the whole website. The term
            cascading comes from the ability to combine multiple CSS files to determine the style for one page. This
            means that styles can inherit and overwrite previously declared styles <cite><a

    <!--How to use CSS, and demonstration of how it can change a webpage-->
    <div class="description section">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A CSS rule set is described in two parts. First, the selector such as an <a
                href="index.html#description">element</a> (paragraph, headings, etc),
            class or id. Second, a series of declarations that assign values to style properties such as text colours,
            background
            colour, font and margins. The syntax is as follows:</p>
        <br>
        <div class="well">
            <pre>selector {property1: value1; property2: value2;}</pre>
        </div>

        <br>
        <p>Click the buttons below to see how significantly a webpage (with the same <a href="index.html">HTML</a>)
            can change by simply changing the CSS.</p>
        <br>
        <ul id="stylelist">
            <li onclick=changeToStyle1()>Style 1</li>
            <li onclick=changeToStyle2()>Style 2</li>
            <li onclick=noCSS()>No Style</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>CSS also allows developers to use 'Pseudo-classes' to select the style of elements when they are in special
            states. For example, hover your mouse over the buttons above. CSS Pseudo-classes have been used to change
            the color as the mouse hovers over. </p>
        <br>
        <div class="well">
            <pre>selector:special-state {property1: value1;}</pre>
        </div>

                    useful
                    basis for discussion. CSS was distinguished from other styling alternatives by accounting for the
                    design
                    requirements of both author and user, acknowledging they would need to be ‘cascaded’ in some way.
