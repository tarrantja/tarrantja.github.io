        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>HTML is the core mark-up language of the World Wide Web. It's purpose is to describe the structure of the
            text-based content of a website <cite><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp"
                    target=_blank>(W3Schools, 2020)</a></cite>.</p>

    <!--Explanation of what HTML looks like and where elements exist on this webpage-->
    <div class="section" id="description">
        <h2>Description</h2>


        <p>Content to be displayed is arranged into a series of elements, represented by tags. These tags are labelled
            pieces of content, such as headings, paragraphs and tables. Hover over each of the lines of HTML below to
            reveal where these elements exist on this page.</p>
        <br>
        <div class="well">
            <pre>
    <span>&lt;body&gt;  &lt;!--This opens the entire body of the page--></span> <!--Code segment-->
        <span onmouseover=hightlightList() onmouseout=highlightNone() id="list">&lt;ul&gt;...&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;!--Unordered List--></span>
        <span onmouseover=highlightHeader1() onmouseout=highlightNone() id="h1">&lt;h1&gt;This is a Heading 1&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
        <span onmouseover=highlightHeader2() onmouseout=highlightNone() id="h2">&lt;h2&gt;This is a Heading 2&lt;/h2&gt;</span>
        <span onmouseover=highlightPara() onmouseout=highlightNone() id="p">&lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</span>
        <span onmouseover=highlightTable() onmouseout=highlightNone() id="table">&lt;table&gt;...&lt;/table&gt;</span> 
    <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span></pre>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>HTML pages can be linked directly to other documents or pages, creating a 'web' of interlinked resources. Typically this is done using the anchor tag as shown below. This has been done in the navigation bar to link the four pages of this website.</p>
